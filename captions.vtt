WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
I'm dodging.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.080
I'm gonna raise one trick.

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:06.839
No, you're not.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.799
Yeah, I am.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:08.560
You're welcome.

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:09.599
No.

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.120
Dude, I'm the best iron one.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.960
Raise shit, bro.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.919
Iron one.

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:15.439
Nick.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.440
I'm good.

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:17.559
You're cracked, bro.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:18.600
I'm wood for.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.080
Bro, wait, you guys are wood.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.559
I'm so stuck in pebble, bro.

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:22.440
You're in pebble?

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.160
Oh, man.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.519
I'm sorry, bro.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.320
I was harpsicked there for a while, but I got out eventually.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.800
I'm still gonna propose you a grip-beling depression.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:40.679
I didn't even realize that I was on the ground.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:41.480
Yeah.

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:42.880
I think they're there.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.200
Nah, nah, there's a...

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.679
Are you sure?

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:46.679
You guys are that way.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:47.879
I think they're there.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.120
It could be anywhere.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.280
I mean, they could be here.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.000
One's there.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.320
One's there.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.679
I'm gonna get one.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:55.400
You saw him?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.400
Get one on there.

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:57.519
You saw him?

00:00:58.839 --> 00:00:59.359
Right there?

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.839
Yep.

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:00.839
Nah, he's nice.

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:01.679
Nice.

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:02.519
I sawed him.

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:03.519
He was over there.

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:04.519
He was over there.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.000
Uh, Uka on site.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.840
Backside, back hall.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.640
He's over there.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.519
Don't worry, I got you.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:10.319
I think he's there.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200
He's over there.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200
Yeah, on site, backside, back hall.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.079
Yeah, there, there, there.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.759
On site, backside, back hall.

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.560
Remember that.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.319
It's important.

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:20.439
Backshot.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.439
I'm coming.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:22.799
Yeah, wait.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.480
Uka.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.480
Yo, it's November.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.359
Oh, shit.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:26.160
I've never nutted.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.719
Do a fake hero clone.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.640
15.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.760
OK, 2 F, 2 F.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.840
Jetton, he can just do a fake hero.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.320
What the fuck?

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.719
Watch out the skies in market.

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.320
Yeah, I don't know about you guys, but that shit was on him.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.920
I think you're moving.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.840
Nah, that doesn't make any sense.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.560
I think you were aiming at the market and not at sky.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.359
You're right.

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:03.439
I just have a passion for shooting up markets.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.240
How about you leave your grocery list at home, huh?

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.760
Oh, fuck.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.800
I'm a full hell of hell.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.159
Don't lose your hair.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.599
It if you lose your gay.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.680
Hey, don't go that way.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.680
I was with Sentens.

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:24.919
On it.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:25.919
On it.

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:26.919
On it.

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:27.919
On it.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.919
On it.

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:29.919
On it.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:30.919
No, no.

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:32.919
To this game isn't about being good at like shooting heads

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.439
or planting the bomb or using abilities.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.359
It's all about financial discipline.

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.479
I'm really good at financial discipline.

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:42.479
Just not I or up.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.159
Don't make it any noise.

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.399
Don't make it any noise.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.399
I left.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.399
Five planted.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:50.919
Here.

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.639
Over there.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.639
I'll be here.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.639
Yeah.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:59.639
Oh, two men.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.639
One enemy remaining.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.639
Please, kids doing.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.639
No idea.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:16.639
Oh, Jets there as well.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.639
Careful.

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.639
Crash.

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:30.639
What a play, dude.

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.639
Do Jan one Jan one still Jan.

00:03:35.639 --> 00:04:04.639
I can't believe they haven't got another kill.

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:11.639
We're just like dodging these things left and right.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:33.639
I might be off.

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:58.419
If he's going to buy some more, you will get tank a bit.

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.919
Okay.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:12.759
Yeah, why are you guys also quiet at 6 p.m.

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:20.759
Where the vibes are?

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:30.759
I was just looking at that.

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.759
Is that one just covered in barbellier?

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:33.759
I'm gonna pull it out.

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.759
What about putting it in?

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:36.759
What do you mean?

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:37.759
I'm actually pulling it out.

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:38.759
Well, you already had to get it in there.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:39.759
Where do those even go in, too?

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:40.759
They hurt that part.

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.759
They put them in the p-hole because they bleed out of their urethra.

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:44.759
Oh.

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.759
It needs a forsaken tampon for those nosebleeds.

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:47.759
Dude.

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:52.759
No, forsaken tampon is literally just like a very splintery thing of wood.

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.759
They just shove up there.

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:55.759
It doesn't do much.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.759
It kind of just plugs the holes when they unplug it.

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:58.759
You know?

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.759
No, it's when you actually don't have a tampon.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:01.759
See, after you know, just make your own.

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.759
You just fingering yourself all day.

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:04.759
No!

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.759
Oh my god, I suck.

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:13.759
Listen, listen.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:14.759
You got the kill.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.759
What matters is you got the kill.

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:18.759
You won.

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:19.759
You're better.

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:20.759
I'm diamond, too.

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:21.759
I should be one tapping people in there.

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:22.759
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:28.759
Hey, why are you holding my friend as such high expectations for every single kill man?

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.759
You can whiff every once in a while.

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:31.759
Okay, buddy?

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:32.759
It's fine.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.759
Oh, hey, you smell your trying?

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:36.759
You smell your trying?

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:38.759
Lack of player stands.

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:39.759
Haha.

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:50.759
Haha.

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.759
You will not kill my ally.

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:54.759
Oh.

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.759
What are these splintering?

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.759
Wait, wait, wait, wait, sing like a singer.

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:00.759
Oh.

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:01.759
Oh.

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:02.759
Oh.

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:03.759
Oh.

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:04.759
Oh.

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:05.759
Oh.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.759
Oh.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:07.759
Oh.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:08.759
Oh.

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:09.759
Oh.

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:10.759
Oh.

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:11.759
Oh.

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:12.759
Oh.

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:13.759
Oh.

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:14.759
Oh.

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:15.759
Oh.

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:16.759
Oh.

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:20.759
I was just pulling into McDonald's right there.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:21.759
Sorry.

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:22.759
I'm tired.

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:23.759
It's a little squeaky.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:24.759
Careful, SpongeBob.

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:25.759
Careful.

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:26.759
Let's go.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:27.759
Careful.

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:28.759
TouchBob.

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:29.759
Be careful.

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:30.759
TouchBob.

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:31.759
Be careful.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:34.759
Haha.

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:38.759
She won't blush herself.

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:39.759
Haha.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:40.759
Haha.

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:41.759
That's so good.

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:42.759
That's so good.

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:45.759
You just saw the jet lookie.

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:48.759
Well, I want my baby back baby back baby back.

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:50.759
I want my baby back baby back.

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:51.759
She leaves.

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:52.759
Oh.

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:53.759
Oh.

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:54.759
Oh.

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:55.759
Oh.

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:56.759
Oh.

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:57.759
Oh.

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:58.759
Oh.

00:07:58.759 --> 00:07:59.759
Oh.

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.759
Oh.

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:06.759
I don't think we're getting to this game.

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:07.759
Yeah.

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.759
I didn't want to play anyway.

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.759
Honestly, I'd rather not be in the game.

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:14.759
Can't lose if you're not on the game.

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:17.759
Because we treat this.

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:18.759
I'm sorry.

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:19.759
Oh.

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:20.759
Three three three out.

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:23.759
I'm sorry.

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:24.759
Hey.

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:25.759
Hey.
